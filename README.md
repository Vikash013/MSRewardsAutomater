### How does it work?

* Reads a text file of every word in the English language
* Randomly selects 30 of them (because the task this automates rewards 3 points per search for a maximum of 90 points -> need 30 searches to achieve points)
* Takes advantage of the desktop.browse function to use the Microsoft Edge browser
* Quickly generates 30 new tabs for each search result in order to make Microsoft Rewards give the user 90 points

### To Use:

1) Go to https://rewards.bing.com/
2) Make a Microsoft account (or log in)
3) See in the top banner where it says Today's Points and click on Points Breakdowbn
4) Where it says PC Search (0/90) click on that and do a few searches until you see the 0/90 increase (running the program without doing this will not generate the 90 points)
5) Run the program
6) Refresh the page or click between a different tab and back to the main site
7) Enjoy the free and effortless 90 points, you can do this once per day!
