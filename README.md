### How does it work?

* Reads a text file of every word in the English language
* Randomly selects 30 of them (because the task this automates rewards 3 points per search for a maximum of 90 points -> need 30 searches to achieve points)
* Takes advantage of the desktop.browse function to use the Microsoft Edge browser
* Quickly generates 30 new tabs for each search result in order to make Microsoft Rewards give the user 90 points
