# MSRewardsAutomater

##Developed a Java-based application to automate Microsoft Reward tasks which includes a user-friendly GUI for ease of use. Generates search results for 30 randomly selected words (from a text file of every word in the English Language) in Microsoft Edge which allows users to earn 90 points per day through automated searches, saving time and effort.

##To Use:

1) Go to https://rewards.bing.com/
2) Make a Microsoft account (or log in)
3) See in the top banner where it says Today's Points and click on Points Breakdowbn
4) Where it says PC Search (0/90) click on that and do a few searches until you see the 0/90 increase (running the program without doing this will not generate the 90 points)
5) Run the program
6) Enjoy the free and effortless 90 points, you can do this once per day!
